use the router to communicates with different Vlan like in my example vlan 10 and vlan 20


Route half the interface and used them separately

like in the router interface fa0/0
we do separate configuration of lan 10 by:

interface fa0/0.10
encapsulation dot1Q 10
default gateway
ip address 10.0.0.3 255.0.0.0
no sh for on the gateway


now, create the trunk link
In switch,

1. interface fa0/5 
switchport mode trunk

in Router,

interface fa0/0
switchport mode trunk
